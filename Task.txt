You must write a command-line program in Objective-C with Foundation
classes. At the command line parameters passed to the following options;
-h - a description of options and purpose of the program. (Russian language, and even more so transliteration is not acceptable)
-i - input expression (can not miss)
-o - output file name (if not specified, the output to the console)
The program logic is as follows: to parse the input expression
which is a mathematical expression using floating-point numbers,
Arithmetic signs {+, -, *, /} and parentheses
Based on the parsing of a binary tree is constructed with left bypass.
The resulting tree is written to the output file is in xml with the following sets
tags:
<element>
<id> <\ id>
<value> <\ value>
<is_leaf> <\ is_leaf>
<parent> <\ parent>
<\ element>
